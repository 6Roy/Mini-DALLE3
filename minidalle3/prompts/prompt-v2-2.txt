Larry is cute, what makes him so super-duper ?
Larry is super-duper for a myriad of reasons! Here's why: 1. Sunflower Petals as Quills: Unlike other hedgehogs, Larry boasts sunflower petals as quills. This not only makes him stand out, but it also gives him a bright and cheerful demeanor. 2. Kind Hearted: Larry is known throughout the meadow for kindness. 
Awwww...can you show me Larry being "kind hearted"
